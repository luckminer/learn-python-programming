# Python learning area
Developer path to learn Python and Web Development with Django.

The best advice I can give you is: â€œLearn by doing! Create projects that bring some benefit to you or the people around you, don't learn new stuff if you don't know why you need it. Learn to prioritize tasks and steps. Focus on 1 thing!"

## 3 Important Skills
1. Algorithms and data structures
2. Programming mindset
3. Know your programming language (analytical, problem-solving mindset)
  
## 0. Computer Science Basics

## 1. Start Learning Python - learn the basics, after completing this step, make your own project using Core Python. You don't need a web app, create a console app, or use [TKinter](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtoC6GglhF3ncJ5rLwQrLGnV).

## 2. Advancing with Python - it is continuous learning. Do in parallel with third step.
- Learn to write Clean Code:

  - [testdriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/clean-code-python)
- Testing with Python: PyTest
- [SOLID Principles](https://github.com/Rustam-Z/advanced-python/tree/main/solid), KISS, DRY
- [Design Patterns](https://github.com/Rustam-Z/advanced-python/tree/main/design_patterns)
- Concurrency and parallelism 
- Read more books: "Fluent Python", "Python Cookbook", "Learning Python", "Clean code in Python" and more

## 3. Start Building Web Apps - Git, HTML, CSS, Databases, Flask & Django, REST API.
- First step: HTML, CSS, understand how the Internet works, what is HTTP, DNS, REST API.

  - Just Google more! 
- Second step: Learn database design, entity relationships (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany), and then move on to django.

  - [Official documentation tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/), but first have a look to [overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/overview/)
- Next step: See how others build projects on django, then create own!!

## Final Thoughts
Learn every day, consistency is very important! Make your own projects, get ideas for your projects by looking at your surrounding.
