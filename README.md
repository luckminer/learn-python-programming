## 1. Start Learning Python

- [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)
- My friend suggested "Python For everybody Specialization from Coursera" and I have found its [YouTube Turorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI), but even if you don't need a certificate go to Coursera because there are many quizes and interesting exams.
- The books I have read: Think Python, Step by Step Guide to Python

## 2. Start Learning Python Django 
- For beginners, I recommend starting with [Haudi's YouTube Django tutorial](https://youtu.be/w4nrT7emiVc) (in Russian)
- Or [Telusko's YouTube Django tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTmQOjsl0eg)
- Then go to [Django Girls tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) 
- [Official documentation tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/), but before read the [overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/overview/) first, I found it very interesting
- [Dennis Ivy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZRcDjjkVajGL6wd76UnGg) YouTube Channel, if you are a beginner start from [here](https://youtu.be/xv_bwpA_aEA)
- Another great YouTube channel is Corey Schafer check [this tutorial series](https://youtu.be/UmljXZIypDc)
- Of course our lovely freeCodeCamp.org [tutorial for begineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4) as well [a guide to building an eCommerce website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZvRrldjf1Y)
- And in the end I recommend the series on [Django specialization from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/django)
- Books: Django 3 by Examples || Django for begineers by Vincent W.
