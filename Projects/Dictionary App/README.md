## Dictionary application using Python

This is your first project in Python. I suggest you to build different version of this project. For example:
- Console application, you may also use `argparse` library.
- Desktop application using `Tkinter`.
- Web application using `Django`, `Flask` frameworks.
- Telegram bot using `telepot`, `aiogram`.
